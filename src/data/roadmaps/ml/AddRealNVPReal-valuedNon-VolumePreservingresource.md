# Add RealNVP (Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving) resource

## Introduction

RealNVP (Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving) is a type of normalizing flow architecture for generative models that was introduced in a 2016 paper by Dinh et al. Normalizing flow models are a type of generative model that transform a simple distribution (e.g., a Gaussian distribution) through a series of invertible transformations into a more complex distribution that models the true data distribution. RealNVP is a specific type of normalizing flow that is designed to work with real-valued data, and it achieves this by applying an affine transformation to each dimension of the input.
