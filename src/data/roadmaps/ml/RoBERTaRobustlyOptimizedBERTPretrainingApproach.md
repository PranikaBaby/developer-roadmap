#  Add RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) resource 

RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) is a language model developed by Facebook AI Research in 2019.
It is based on the BERT architecture but incorporates several modifications that improve its performance on various natural language processing tasks.RoBERTa is trained on a larger amount of data and for a longer duration than BERT, resulting in better language understanding capabilities.It uses dynamic masking during training, which means that the masking pattern is randomly changed during each training epoch, leading to better generalization.RoBERTa has achieved state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, including the GLUE and SuperGLUE tasks.It is available as a pre-trained model that can be fine-tuned on various downstream NLP tasks.
