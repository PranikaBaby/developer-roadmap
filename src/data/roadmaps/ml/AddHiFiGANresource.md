# Add HiFiGAN resource

HiFiGAN is a generative adversarial network (GAN) that is designed for high-fidelity audio generation.It uses a waveform discriminator and generator architecture to synthesize high-quality audio samples that are close to real human voices or instruments.HiFiGAN has been trained on a large dataset of high-quality audio recordings, which enables it to generate realistic sounds and preserve the natural characteristics of the input signals.This technology can be used in various applications such as music production, speech synthesis, and voice cloning.In summary, HiFiGAN is a powerful resource for generating high-quality audio signals that can be used in a variety of applications, particularly those that require realistic sound synthesis.
