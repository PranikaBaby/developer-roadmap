# Add Variational Recurrent Autoencoder resource

## Introduction

A Variational Recurrent Autoencoder (VRAE) is a type of neural network that can learn to encode and decode sequential data, such as time series or text.The VRAE model combines elements of both recurrent neural networks and variational autoencoders, allowing it to capture both the temporal dependencies and latent representations of the data.VRAEs are often used in applications such as anomaly detection, language modeling, and speech recognition.Implementing a VRAE requires specialized knowledge in deep learning and programming, as well as access to appropriate datasets and computational resources.There are many online resources available for learning about VRAEs, including tutorials, research papers, and code repositories.
