# Add BigBiGAN resource 

BigBiGAN is a generative model architecture that uses unsupervised learning to produce high-quality images.It is a type of GAN, or Generative Adversarial Network, that uses two neural networks to generate images.The first neural network, called the generator, creates images from random noise.The second neural network, called the discriminator, evaluates the quality of the generated images and provides feedback to the generator.The BigBiGAN architecture adds an encoder network that can map real-world images to the latent space used by the generator.This makes it possible to use BigBiGAN for image manipulation tasks, such as generating new images from existing ones, or creating animations.
