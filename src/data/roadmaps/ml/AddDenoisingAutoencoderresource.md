# Add Denoising Autoencoder resource

## Introduction

A denoising autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network that is trained to remove noise from data.
It works by first corrupting the input data with random noise, then attempting to reconstruct the original signal.
During training, the network learns to identify and remove the noise, while preserving the underlying structure of the data.Adding denoising capabilities can be useful for tasks such as image or speech recognition, where noise in the input data can degrade performance.Implementations of denoising autoencoders are available in various deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
