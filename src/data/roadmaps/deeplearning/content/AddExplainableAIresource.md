# Add Explainable AI resource

## Introduction

Explainable AI (XAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that aims to make machine learning models more transparent and understandable to humans.XAI is important because it helps build trust and confidence in AI systems, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and national security.There are various techniques for implementing XAI, including rule-based systems, decision trees, and model-agnostic methods such as LIME and SHAP.XAI can also involve designing user interfaces that provide users with insights into how the AI system arrived at a particular decision or recommendation.Overall, XAI is a critical component in the development of responsible and trustworthy AI systems that can effectively serve humanity's needs.
