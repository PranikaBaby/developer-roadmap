# Add Model Predictive Control (MPC) resource

## Introduction

Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a control technique used in process control systems to optimize the system's performance. It involves creating a model of the process and predicting its behavior over a specific time horizon. MPC uses this model to predict the system's future behavior and then determines the optimal control inputs to achieve a desired outcome. By continuously adjusting the control inputs based on real-time measurements, MPC can improve system performance and reduce costs. MPC is widely used in industries such as chemical, petrochemical, and manufacturing.
